-----------------

The ACLU seeks a full-time position of **Staff Attorney,** **Senior Staff Attorne**y, or **Senior** **Counsel** in the **Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer & HIV Project** of the ACLU’s national office in **New York, NY.** This is a **hybrid role** that has in-office requirements of two (2) days per week or eight (8) days per month.

Through the LGBTQ & HIV Project, founded in 1986, the ACLU seeks to create a just society for all LGBTQ people and people living with HIV regardless of race or income. Through litigation, lobbying, public education, and organizing, the ACLU works to build a country where our communities can live openly without discrimination and enjoy equal rights, personal autonomy, and freedom of expression and association. The ACLU has been a leading advocate for LGBTQ rights for decades, having brought its first gay rights case in 1936, its first transgender rights case in 1967, and having served as counsel in six of the past seven United States Supreme Court cases involving LGBTQ-related issues. Our advocacy strategies are built around the idea that fighting for civil rights means not just persuading judges and legislatures but ultimately changing the way people think about us and our issues.

Today, the ACLU and its state affiliate offices in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico do more litigation, policy advocacy, legislative lobbying, ballot campaigns, and public education work on LGBTQ issues than any other national civil rights organization. In the face of the unrelenting attacks on trans people from the states and the current federal administration, we are prioritizing our work for transgender justice in particular. Doing this work as part of the broad civil liberties agenda of the ACLU reflects the reality that the LGBTQ and HIV communities are part of other social change movements and that we must work together if we are to achieve a just society for all. The ACLU strives to ensure that the full diversity of the LGBTQ and HIV-affected communities is reflected in its work and continues to explore ways to make our efforts more impactful for people of color, people living with disabilities, people living in poverty, and others who have been historically excluded by our movements.

This position is part of a collective bargaining unit. It is represented by ACLU Staff United (ASU).

**WHAT YOU'LL DO**
