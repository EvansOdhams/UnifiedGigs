Much of what you need to know about minds + assembly is captured in the name itself: we think we create and (+) we put things together. It’s really that simple—and that shockingly different. Of course, the simplicity of our name belies the depth of what we deliver to our most honored (and often overjoyed) clients. Our work is consistently at a higher caliber than they are used to, simply because we push ourselves to think and build differently. Combine this with an obsessive attention to client service, and you arrive at a place where we stand alone among agencies. Arrogant? No. Confident? Of course, but only because we’ve put together a team of people who are good AF in every way.  
  
At minds + assembly, the engine of our business is commercial invention. We approach every project—actually, every aspect of our work—as an opportunity to dip our toes into the revitalizing stream of the new. The original conception of our agency (which has since been realized) was that of a happy workshop, a place where the mind and hands are free to construct brilliant new things for our clients. Yet, we never forget that we are in fact a business. Everything we do is to further the commercial goals of our clients, whether that is to sell a product or an idea. To achieve this, we continue to add only the best people, those who have the right talent, temperament, and teamwork-orientation to further our collective goals. Then we ask that each person adhere to two simple and equally important principles: uncompromising standards and unconditional support. In other words, we push each other, hard, to produce the best work possible, yet always with the knowledge that we have each other’s backs.
