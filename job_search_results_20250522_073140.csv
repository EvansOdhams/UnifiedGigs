Google User Experience (UX) is made up of multi-disciplinary teams of UX Designers, Researchers, Writers, Content Strategists, Program Managers, and Engineers: we care deeply about the people who use our products. The UX team plays an integral part in gathering insights about the attitudes, emotions, needs, and behaviors of people who use our products to inspire and inform design. We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google’s businesses.

You’ll combine skills in behavioral research design, statistical methods, and general programming to improve user experience.  
  
The Quantitative UXR community at Google will help you do your best work. You’ll have the opportunity to work with and learn from UXRs across Google through regular meetups, mentor programs, and access to internal research tools.

* Identify, measure, and optimize drivers of consumer sentiment and engagement with Google's products. Evolve how product teams quantify user phenomena (e.g., attention, perception, information processing, utility, intent, attitudes, behavioral patterns).
* Design, conduct, and analyze UX experiments (i.e., in-product live experiments and highly controlled off-product experiments).
* Collaborate with analysts and engineers across Google to develop and maintain the metrics frameworks, research tools, and data infrastructure that power UX measurement.

The New York Post delivers the best in News, Sports, Entertainment and Pop Culture with wit, irreverence, and authority. Over the past 224 years, The Post has evolved into a multi-platform media company spanning print, digital, video, audio, app, television and commerce.

The Post’s Editorial Page is where bold ideas meet razor-sharp commentary. As one of the country’s most recognized opinion sections, our team tackles the most pressing local, national, and global issues — delivering sharp, fearless takes in the distinct voice that defines the Post. From holding public officials accountable to weighing in on global conflicts, we cut through the noise with clarity, wit, and purpose.

We’re looking for a nimble, thoughtful, and fast-moving Editorial Page Writer (M-F) to join our Opinion team. This writer will contribute impactful editorials daily — helping shape the voice of our institutional stance — while also crafting occasional bylined opinion columns. The ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the Post’s signature tone: smart, punchy, skeptical of orthodoxy, and unafraid to challenge both sides of the aisle. This role is key to helping our readers make sense of a fast-changing world and will contribute to both our print and digital platforms.

Responsibilities:

* Write timely, engaging, and factually sound unsigned editorials under tight deadlines, aligned with the Post’s voice and editorial stance
* Occasionally contribute bylined opinion columns on topics of expertise or general interest
* Pitch compelling editorial ideas that respond to breaking news or trends in politics, policy, and culture
* Collaborate closely with the editorial team to shape daily and long-term coverage priorities
* Monitor current events across a wide range of topics including New York City and state politics, national affairs, foreign policy and broader cultural issues
* Join in team preparation of copy for both digital publication (using WordPress and other CMS tools) and print.
* Help amplify opinion content’s reach (including via social media) with sharp headlines and an eye toward engagement
* Represent the editorial board externally as needed, including occasional interviews, panels, or media appearances

Requirements:

* At least 5 years of experience in political commentary, editorial writing, or a related field
* Deep understanding of New York politics and national political dynamics
* Exceptional writing skills: clear, direct, and persuasive prose under deadline
* Strong editorial judgment and a keen news sense
* Comfort with WordPress or similar content management systems
* Familiarity with SEO best practices and social media strategy
* A sharp eye for narrative, logic, and tone — especially attuned to the Post’s unique voice
* Ability to work independently while thriving in a collaborative, high-paced newsroom environment

*Note: The New York Post currently adheres to a hybrid work model. This position will be expected to report into our NYC office 4 days per week.*

At The New York Post we recognize that attracting the best talent is key to our strategy and success as a company. As a result, our ranges reflect our good faith estimate to pay fairly as to what our ideal candidates are likely to expect, and we tailor our offers within the range based on the selected candidate's experience, industry knowledge, technical and communication skills, and other factors that may prove relevant during the interview process.

In addition to compensation, the company provides eligible employees a comprehensive and highly competitive benefits package, with a variety of physical health, retirement and savings, caregiving, emotional wellbeing, transportation, and other benefits, including “elective” benefits employees may select to best fit the needs and personal situations of our diverse workforce.

As an equal opportunity employer, the New York Post does not discriminate in hiring or the terms and conditions of employment because of an individual’s race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, gender, sexual orientation, citizenship or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local law.
