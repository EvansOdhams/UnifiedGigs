The NY-RaMP connects the selected emerging scholars to the CUNY Brooklyn-based Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) DNA Learning Center for molecular biology and gene-based orientation boot-camp (in addition to follow-up field trips), to State University of New York's (SUNY's) leadership and campuses, to the Skirball Science Learning Center (at Hunter College), to the Cornell Center for Cultural Humility, to active NY Biology Industry field trips, and to visits to NY-area Colleges and Universities. This trans-disciplinary inquiry focused program is designed for engaged collaborative discovery-science for mentors and mentees to gain deep understandings of cellular signaling in a diverse comprehensive environment.
