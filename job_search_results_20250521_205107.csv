### **What you’ll be doing...**

As a full-time Verizon Retail Sales Associate, you’ll have the opportunity to grow your career with a team focused on unlocking your full potential and sales success within one of our retail stores. Here's what you can expect:

* Generate retail sales by using your passion for cutting-edge technology, and exceptional customer service to expand the Verizon network.
* Learn and uncover customers' needs by creating connections and asking the right questions.
* Position product insights and solution recommendations to provide customers with a complete top-down sales solution.
* Close sales by using phenomenal communication skills to fulfill customer needs with simple and intuitive tech solutions.

Planning to go above and beyond? With our commission program, the opportunities are unlimited for employees who exceed their sales goals. Top performers could make an extra $14,500 or more in individual-based commissions, giving you the chance to earn a total of $65,000+ to $73,500+ annually. Compensation varies by geography, hours worked, and performance.
